This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```






```{r}
distance_mat <- dist(mtcars, method = 'euclidean')
distance_mat
 
# Fitting Hierarchical clustering Model
# to training dataset
set.seed(240)  # Setting seed
Hierar_cl <- hclust(distance_mat, method = "average")
Hierar_cl
 
# Plotting dendrogram
plot(Hierar_cl)
 
# Choosing no. of clusters
# Cutting tree by height
abline(h = 110, col = "green")
 
# Cutting tree by no. of clusters
fit <- cutree(Hierar_cl, k = 3 )
fit
 
table(fit)
rect.hclust(Hierar_cl, k = 3, border = "green")
