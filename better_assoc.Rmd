This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}

```{r}
## Example 1: Create transaction data and mine association rules
a_list <- list(
      c("a","b","c"),
      c("a","b"),
      c("a","b","d"),
      c("c","e"),
      c("a","b","d","e")
      )

## Set transaction names
names(a_list) <- paste("Tr",c(1:5), sep = "")
a_list

## Use the constructor to create transactions
trans1 <- transactions(a_list)
trans1

rules <- apriori(trans1)
inspect(rules)

## Example 2: Mine association rules from an existing transactions dataset
##   using different minimum support and minimum confidence thresholds
data("Adult")

rules <- apriori(Adult,
	parameter = list(supp = 0.5, conf = 0.9, target = "rules"))
summary(rules)

plot(rules,engine="plotly")
