This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
data(iris)
  
# Structure 
str(iris)
```


```{r}
library(caTools)
library(randomForest)
  
# Splitting data in train and test data
split <- sample.split(iris, SplitRatio = 0.7)
split
  
train <- subset(iris, split == "TRUE")
test <- subset(iris, split == "FALSE")
```


```{r}
classifier_RF = randomForest(x = train[-5],y = train$Species)
```


```{r}
classifier_RF
```


```{r}

y_pred = predict(classifier_RF, newdata = test[-5])
```


```{r}
confusion_mtx = table(test[, 5], y_pred)
